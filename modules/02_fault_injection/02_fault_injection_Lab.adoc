= Fault Injection Lab

== Overview
This exercise shows how to inject faults and test the resiliency of your application. Istio provides a set of failure
recovery features that can be taken advantage of by the services in an application. Features include:

* Timeouts
* Bounded retries with timeout budgets and variable jitter between retries
* Limits on number of concurrent connections and requests to upstream services
* Active (periodic) health checks on each member of the load balancing pool
* Fine-grained circuit breakers (passive health checks) – applied per instance in the load balancing pool

Together, these features enable the service mesh to tolerate failing nodes and prevent localized failures
from cascading instability to other nodes.

== Goals

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Apply chaos engineering by injecting HTTP errors and network delays. 

== HTTP Error 503

By default, recommendation v1 and v2 are being randomly load-balanced as that is the default behavior in Kubernetes/OpenShift.

. Inject 503’s, for approximately 50% of the requests:
+
-----
oc create -f ${ISTIO_LAB_HOME}/src/istiofiles/route-rule-recommendation-503.yml -n ${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}
-----

. After a few seconds, access the service 10 times:
+
-----
for i in $(seq 10); do
  curl "http://customer-${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}.{{APPS_SUFFIX}}"
done
-----

* You should see about half the time a failure `customer => 503 preference => 503 fault filter abort`.

. Remove the fault injector:
+
-----
oc delete routerule/recommendation-503 -n ${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}
-----

== Delay

The most insidious of possible distributed computing faults is not a "down" service but a service that is responding slowly, potentially causing a cascading failure in your network of services.

. Inject a delay:
+
-----
oc create -f ${ISTIO_LAB_HOME}/src/istiofiles/route-rule-recommendation-delay.yml -n ${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}
-----

. Now access the customer endpoint repeatedly:
+
-----
while true; do
  curl "http://customer-${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}.{{APPS_SUFFIX}}"
done
-----

* You will notice many requests to the customer endpoint now have a delay (the rule injects a 7 second delay half the time when the `recommendation` service is called).

. You can also see this in Jaeger by opening
the Jaeger console once again (see above for how to access the URL).

. Select `recommendation` from the **Service** drop-down and click **Find Traces**.

* Some traces are fast, but some traces will show the delay: TODO: add trace image

. Remove the delay:
+
----
oc delete routerule/recommendation-delay -n ${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}
----

== Retry

Here we can force Istio to retry failed service calls so that the application doesn't have to deal with retrying.

We will use Istio and return HTTP Error 503 about 50% of the time. 

. Send all users to `v2` which will throw out some 503’s:
+
----
oc create -f ${ISTIO_LAB_HOME}/src/istiofiles/route-rule-recommendation-v2_503.yml -n ${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}
----

. Access the customer endpoint several times, you should see some 503’s:
+
----
for i in $(seq 20); do
  curl "http://customer-${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}.{{APPS_SUFFIX}}"
done
----

. Add the retry rule to make Istio retry when a 503 is received:
+
----
oc create -f ${ISTIO_LAB_HOME}/src/istiofiles/route-rule-recommendation-v2_retry.yml -n ${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}
----

. After a few seconds, things will settle down and the calls should succeed 100% of the time as Istio will retry whenever a 503 is received:
+
----
for i in $(seq 20); do
  curl "http://customer-${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}.{{APPS_SUFFIX}}"
done
----

NOTE: You may need to wait up to 30 seconds for the retry rule to take effect. Just run the above command again if you see any `503`'s. You should eventually not see any.
+
. Cleanup the retries and injected faults:
+
----
oc delete routerule/recommendation-v2-retry routerule/recommendation-v2-503  -n ${ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT}
----
